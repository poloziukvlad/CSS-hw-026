            OUR STORY - The UK's Most Ethical Florist
          </h1>

          <p class="px-4 py-4">
            Over the last 14 years, we've delivered more than 10 million
            beautiful bouquets across the length and breadth of the UK. 10
            million bouquets is a lot, but we don't like to think of it like
            that. Every order we receive is arranged and hand-tied by our
            florists to create a unique bouquet. Just as each customer is
            different, so is each bouquet, so we treat each one individually. We
            strive to make our international and domestic supply chain kinder to
            people and the environment in everything we do.
